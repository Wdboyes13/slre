CHANGES to SLRE by Wdboyes13

The following changes were made to the original SLRE (https://github.com/cesanta/slre):

- Modified the code to be compatible with the custom kernel environment used in WKern
  (https://github.com/Wdboyes13/wkern), including replacing or adapting standard library 
  functions (e.g., `strlen`, `strcher`, `tolower`, etc.) with WKern equivalents. (Prefixed with k-)

No functional changes were made to the core regex engine logic.
